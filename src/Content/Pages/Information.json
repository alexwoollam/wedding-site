          "There is no specific dress code but we’d love you to dress up in your favourite glad rags! The venue is on a farm with a wild flower meadow, walled garden and hedge maze we’d love for you to be able to explore but please be aware of uneven ground and pot holes. You might want to think carefully before wearing the heels. The bridal party are all going for flats!"
